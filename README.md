# Text Classification Method Analysis
#### Connor Morin, Annie Pi, Christina Yi, Jiangyuan Yuan, Jonathan Zhao

## Abstract/Midterm Report:
This project presents a comparative analysis of diverse text processing methodologies applied to document classification and news story summarization. We begin by implementing classical machine learning classifiers, including logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors, using foundational text representations such as bag-of-words and TF-IDF. To capture richer semantic information, we develop neural network models, including feed-forward architectures and LSTM-based models that utilize word embeddings. In addition, we explore state of the art transformer architectures by fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model and assess mainstream large language models under both zero-shot and few-shot conditions. Experiments across multiple datasets will enable a systematic evaluation of each approach using rigorous, task-specific metrics. Ultimately, this project aims to quantify the strengths and limitations of each method, establishing a robust foundation for real-world text processing applications.
